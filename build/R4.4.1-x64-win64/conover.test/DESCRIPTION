Title: Conover-Iman Test of Multiple Comparisons Using Rank Sums
Author: Alexis Dinno
Maintainer: Alexis Dinno <alexis.dinno@pdx.edu>
Description: Computes the Conover-Iman test (1979) for 0th-order stochastic dominance and reports the results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis omnibus test for i0th-order stochastic dominance among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). conover.test makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Conover-Iman t-test-statistic of the rank differences. The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location, Conover-Iman test may be understood as a test for median difference and for mean difference. conover.test accounts for tied ranks. The Conover-Iman test is strictly valid if and only if the corresponding Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis is rejected.
